# Other curricula

OSSU is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue computer science independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

- [Google - Guide for Technical Development](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html)
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [Obtaining a Thorough CS Background Online](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/05/15/obtaining-thorough-cs-background-online/)
- [P1xt](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides)

What differentiates OSSU? OSSU is dedicated to how an individual can learn the undergraduate CS curriculum. This is why we use the [CS2013](../CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md) as our curricular guidelines. These guidelines are written by the two foremost professional organizations in computing.

This approach has the benefit of clarifying to others the extent of a student's study and understanding. Students have gone from OSSU study into both tech industry employment and into Computer Science graduate school. We look forward to helping you do the same.
